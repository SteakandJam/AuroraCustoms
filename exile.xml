			<p>You have been singled out as unwelcome in the group or society you were raised in, and have become isolated. Perhaps this was your own choice, your critical mind leading you to reject the rules of your society and leave as a conscientious objector, or you simply never fit in and chose to seek someplace you might belong better. Alternatively, you may have been forcibly ejected for your (mis)deeds or ideas, having done something inexcusable or speaking out contrary to those who rule. Regardless of how it occurred, you are no longer a part of your home culture, and have had to survive on your own.‚Äù</p>

		<description>
			<p>You've learned to see society in a different way than most and can more critically evaluate it. As you spend time in a city, town, or tribe, the social dynamics of the system quickly become evident to you. By interacting with locals and spending time in the area you are able to determine things like the current balance of power, pressing issues and news, if there is unhappiness with the current status quo, and who important figures might be. However as an outsider, your criticism or interference are less welcome without good reason.</p>
